## About me

I am an aspiring scientist in the field of computational neuroscience, interested in developing theories on the dynamics of learning and memory in the brain, with possible applications to machine learning. I have strong mathematical background and hands-on experience with advanced methods from statistical physics and computer science, applied to analyze problems and experimental results from neuroscience and machine learning.

## Research Interests

*	Population coding and manifold representation of sensory information.
*	Biological learning and its relation to memory encoding and recall.
*	Neural implementation of world-models and its application to reinforcement learning.
*	Biological alternatives to error backpropagation, implementation of gradient descent.
*	Predictive coding and its relation to learning and memory.
